1. Nested while loops
- When variables are declared:
- they should only be initialized right before they are used in their respective loop.
- In the case of nested loops,
- where, for instance, variables i and j are declared (as 'int' type in this case):
- If i is the first variable to be used in the first loop, you will initialize it first (assigned a value).
- Then just before the second loop is made, j will be initialized.

2. C -functions
